1. What is the Java Virtual Machine and what is byte code?  
Java virtual machine JVM = JVM is a virtual machine that enables a computer to run Java programs as well as programs written in other languages and compiled to Java bytecode. 
Byte code = bytecode is the result of the compilation of a Java program.

2. How do you compile and run your java program without the help of an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) (e.g., an IDE like Eclipse)? 
In the terminal, javac for example.

3. What is a main method in java? Explain signature parts of the main method? 
A Java application is a public Java class with a main() method. The main() method is the start point of the application. 
Signature: public static void main(String[] args) 

4. What are wrapper classes?  
A class’ object that wraps or contains a primitive data type.

5. What is a constructor? 
A block of code that initializes the newly created object.

6. What is a package? Why is important to declare classes inside packages? 
A pack of group, classes, interfaces etc for a java project.
A package as the name suggests is a pack(group) of classes, interfaces and other packages. 
It is important because we need to organize our classes and interfaces.

7. Which access modifiers are available in Java? What is the default visibility or access level for classes, methods, and fields? 
Public
Protected
Private

8. What is the difference between equals() and == ? 
equals() = equality of objects
== = compare primitives

9. What is method overloading and method overriding? 
Overloading =  when two or more methods in one class have the same method name but different parameters. 
Overriding =  having two methods with the same method name and parameters 

10. What are different ways to iterate over a list? 
For Loop
Advanced For Loop
Iterator 
While Loop
Collection’s stream() util (Java8)

11. What are the basic interfaces of Java Collections Framework? 
Set
List
Queue
Deque

12. What it means by Generics in Java, why do we need Generics?
Generics are a facility of generic programming. 

We need generics to extend Java's type system to allow “a type or method to operate on objects of various types while providing compile-time type safety”.

13. In the context of Java, what is an Exception? And what is an Error?  
An event that occurs during the execution that interferes the normal flow of the program.

An error occurs the method it happens in creates an object and “gives it”  to the runtime system.

14. What is unit testing? And what is JUnit?
 Unit testing = testing the smaller units of your application, like classes, interfaces and methods. JUnit =  an unit testing framework.

15. How do I write a test that passes when an expected exception is thrown? With a try catch block.
try {
//doing something
} catch(exception(type) e(object)){
//error handling
}
